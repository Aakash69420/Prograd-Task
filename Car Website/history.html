He started out by designing and building custom cars for wealthy clients, but soon realized that he could make a bigger impact by building cars for the masses.</p>
			<p>In 1958, AAKARS Cars Company introduced its first mass-produced car, the AAKARS 1000. The car was an instant success and quickly became known for its innovative design and superior performance.
